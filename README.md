# oxideav-mp3

A pure-Rust **MPEG-1 / MPEG-2 Audio Layer III** (MP3) codec for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace) framework.

## Status

**Orphan-rebuild scaffold (2026-05-24).** The prior implementation was
retired under the workspace
[clean-room policy](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace/blob/master/docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md):
several of its data tables and decode-loop structures were documented
as having been consulted from external reference implementations
(their source, not the ISO/IEC specification). The clean-room policy
forbids consulting any external implementation's source for any
reason, independent of that reference's licensing, so the provenance
could not be defended. Master history was fully erased per the Hat-3
cold-enforcement procedure.

The implementation will be re-built from scratch against the staged
ISO/IEC 11172-3 / 13818-3 Layer III specification (numeric tables read
only from the standard) in a future clean-room round.
