## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Clean-room MPEG audio **framing** layer in the new `frame` module,
  built solely from ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993 (§2.4.1.3 / §2.4.2.3) and
  ISO/IEC 13818-3:1997 (§2.4.2.3 lower-sampling-frequency
  redefinitions):
  - `parse_header` → typed `Mp3FrameHeader` (syncword validation;
    MPEG-1/MPEG-2 version via the `ID` bit; layer; CRC-protection
    flag; per-version/per-layer bitrate ladders; sampling frequency;
    padding; channel mode; mode_extension; copyright/original;
    emphasis). Reserved/forbidden field values are rejected via a
    typed `HeaderError`.
  - Per-frame byte-length computation including the padding slot
    (`Mp3FrameHeader::frame_len`), with `samples_per_frame` and
    `channel_count` helpers. Free-format frames report no length.
  - `FrameWalker`: a self-delimiting frame iterator with mid-stream
    resynchronisation on bad sync, garbage gaps, and truncated
    trailing frames.
  - 22 unit tests built from spec-derived byte patterns.
- Clean-room MPEG-1 Layer III **side-information** parser in the new
  `side_info` module, built solely from ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993 §2.4.1.7
  (syntax) and §2.4.2.7 (semantics):
  - `parse_side_info` → typed `SideInfo` over the fixed-size block
    (17 bytes mono / 32 bytes stereo): `main_data_begin` (9 bits),
    `private_bits` (5-bit mono / 3-bit stereo), and `scfsi[ch][band]`
    (4 bands/channel).
  - Per-granule (×2) per-channel `GranuleChannel`: `part2_3_length`,
    `big_values`, `global_gain`, `scalefac_compress`,
    `window_switching_flag`, the window-switching branch
    (`block_type` via a typed `BlockType`, `mixed_block_flag`,
    `table_select`, `subblock_gain`, plus the §2.4.2.7 default
    `region0_count` / `region1_count`) versus the long-block branch
    (`table_select[3]`, `region0_count`, `region1_count`), and
    `preflag` / `scalefac_scale` / `count1table_select`.
  - Non-Layer-III headers and short slices are rejected via a typed
    `SideInfoError` (`NotLayer3` / `TooShort`).
- MPEG-2 / MPEG-2.5 **LSF (lower-sampling-frequency) side-info**
  variant in `side_info`, built solely from ISO/IEC 13818-3:1997
  §2.4.1.7 (syntax) and §2.4.2.7 (semantics). `parse_side_info` now
  dispatches on `Mp3FrameHeader::version`:
  - LSF form decodes a fixed-size block (9 bytes mono / 17 bytes
    stereo, matching the §2.4.2.4 CRC bit ranges) with an 8-bit
    `main_data_begin`, `private_bits` (1-bit mono / 2-bit stereo),
    **no** `scfsi`, and a **single** granule.
  - Per-channel `scalefac_compress` widens to 9 bits; `preflag` is
    not transmitted in LSF (§2.4.2.7 derives it from
    `scalefac_compress`), so the parser leaves it `false`.
  - `GranuleChannel::scalefac_compress` widened `u8` → `u16`;
    `SideInfo` gains `lsf` and `granule_count` markers and a
    layout-aware `byte_len()`; new `GRANULES_LSF`,
    `SIDE_INFO_BYTES_LSF_MONO`, `SIDE_INFO_BYTES_LSF_STEREO`
    constants. `SideInfoError::NotMpeg1` renamed `NotLayer3` (both
    MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 Layer III are now parsed).
  - 16 side-info unit tests total (was 10) from spec-derived byte
    patterns: MPEG-1 mono/stereo long + window-switching +
    saturation, plus LSF mono/stereo long, LSF window-switched short,
    LSF max-field saturation, LSF too-short, and LSF trailing-byte
    cases.
- `register()` remains a no-op (no decoder/demuxer wired yet); the
  decode/encode surface still returns `Error::NotImplemented`.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-24** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`). The retired implementation
  documented several of its data tables and decode-loop structures
  as having been consulted from external reference implementations
  rather than derived solely from the ISO/IEC specification. The
  clean-room policy forbids consulting any external implementation's
  source for any reason, regardless of that reference's licensing.

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The cross-crate
  dependencies on `oxideav-id3` and `oxideav-mp1` (the latter for a
  re-exported synthesis-window table) were dropped. The crates.io
  version (`0.1.2`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.

### Next

- Clean-room re-implementation against the staged ISO/IEC 11172-3 /
  13818-3 Layer III specification (numeric tables read only from the
  standard) in a future round.
