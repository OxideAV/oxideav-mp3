# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Clean-room MPEG audio **framing** layer in the new `frame` module,
  built solely from ISO/IEC 11172-3:1993 (§2.4.1.3 / §2.4.2.3) and
  ISO/IEC 13818-3:1997 (§2.4.2.3 lower-sampling-frequency
  redefinitions):
  - `parse_header` → typed `Mp3FrameHeader` (syncword validation;
    MPEG-1/MPEG-2 version via the `ID` bit; layer; CRC-protection
    flag; per-version/per-layer bitrate ladders; sampling frequency;
    padding; channel mode; mode_extension; copyright/original;
    emphasis). Reserved/forbidden field values are rejected via a
    typed `HeaderError`.
  - Per-frame byte-length computation including the padding slot
    (`Mp3FrameHeader::frame_len`), with `samples_per_frame` and
    `channel_count` helpers. Free-format frames report no length.
  - `FrameWalker`: a self-delimiting frame iterator with mid-stream
    resynchronisation on bad sync, garbage gaps, and truncated
    trailing frames.
  - 22 unit tests built from spec-derived byte patterns.
- `register()` remains a no-op (no decoder/demuxer wired yet); the
  decode/encode surface still returns `Error::NotImplemented`.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-24** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`). The retired implementation
  documented several of its data tables and decode-loop structures
  as having been consulted from external reference implementations
  rather than derived solely from the ISO/IEC specification. The
  clean-room policy forbids consulting any external implementation's
  source for any reason, regardless of that reference's licensing.

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The cross-crate
  dependencies on `oxideav-id3` and `oxideav-mp1` (the latter for a
  re-exported synthesis-window table) were dropped. The crates.io
  version (`0.1.2`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.

### Next

- Clean-room re-implementation against the staged ISO/IEC 11172-3 /
  13818-3 Layer III specification (numeric tables read only from the
  standard) in a future round.
